# Agentic Starter - Orchestrator + Payments Tool (demo)
### How it works now

UserInputNode inspects the goal and asks for any missing fields interactively.

PlannerNode checks if all required fields are present. If not â†’ waits for user input.

ExecutionNode only runs when the plan is fully ready.

MonitorNode + ReplannerNode handle success/failure as before.

### Features
Fully interactive: prompts user for missing data in natural language.

Goal evaluation: ensures all required fields are collected before execution.

Dynamic multi-agent orchestration: loads agents from YAML files.

Conditional execution: only executes if goals are satisfied.

Replanning support: retries if execution fails.
